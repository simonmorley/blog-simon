Recently purchased a Mavic DJI Mini 2. Mostly on a whim during a stressful day at work but I've become obsessed with it. The shots it takes are phenomenal - looking down on the world is just so peaceful.

I don't have too much time to tinker with the pics but I've defo enjoyed working with the RAW images. Have been focused on the sunsets, since they're stunning where I live. The shadows though are just so dark without adjusting. Probably got a little carried away adjusting things in potatoshop though!
